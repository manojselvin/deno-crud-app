### Deno (Crud using MongoDB)
Crud with new deno framework and MongoDB database, also added error handler and error middleware

### Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the project.
2. Install Mongodb if not installed already.
2. `cd` into cloned project directory.
3. To start the project run `deno run --unstable --allow-plugin -A server.ts`
4. Enjoy!

### API Documentation:
Will be added soon!

### Notes:
1. run -> runs the typescript file of deno app
2. --unstable --allow-plugin -> To allow plugins that are not yet stable eg. MongoDB driver for deno.
3. -A -> Allow all permission to deno Only use this in develoment mode (Refer point 1 below).

### Points:
1. Sandbox - By default deno runs on sandbox ie. will not have any permissions eg. read, write, network etc.
